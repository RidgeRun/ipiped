ipiped
------

Image Pipe Daemon is a daemon with DBus interface that allows to control and
interact with the functionality provided by the image pipe (ipipe) hardware
on Texas Instruments SoC families like Davincis or OMAP.

Drivers exists for controlling the functionality of the image procesing found
on this SoCs, however ipiped offers and extra layer of funcionality to make
easier for applications to control the settings.

ipiped also supports running implementations of algorithms running with support
from the ipipe hardware (like autoexposure/autowhite balance algorithms).
Currentely ipiped supports RidgeRun's proprietary AEW/AE library but it can be
extended to integrate with others.
